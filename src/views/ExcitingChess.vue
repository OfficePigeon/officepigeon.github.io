		<h1>Exciting Chess</h1>
		<h2>What is "Exciting Chess"?</h2>
		<p>
			The pithy answer is that <i>Exciting Chess</i> is chess but more exciting. The better answer is that it is an
			improvisation game based on the structure of chess. I drafted the first informal rules of <i>Exciting Chess</i>
			during my time in college studying game design. I became very interested in emergent gameplay and found myself
			constantly surrounded by theater performers and comedians: a perfect pool of test subjects for my profane
			experiments (showing up to game night with a scrappy prototype and the desire to make something fun).
		</p>
		<h2>The rules of Exciting Chess</h2>
		<p>
			<i>Exciting Chess</i> is an improvisation game and the way each match plays out will vary significantly based on
			the players and any house rules in place. The core rules of play are based on the eponymous game of chess. If you
			are unfamiliar with the rules of chess, it would be wise to learn them before attempting to play
			<i>Exciting Chess</i>.
		</p>
		<p style="text-align:center">
			<span class="text-note">
				In a future version of this page, I will try to embed a short refresher on the rules of chess.
			</span>
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Exciting Chess</i> has one primary rule that distinguishes it from chess: Any player may, at their own
			discretion, take any action they please, whether it is in conflict with the rules or draws inferences about the
			state of conflict at play. An example action may be suggesting that a Pawn flee (move backward) in the face of a
			substantial threat or that a King may stand its ground and choose to remain in check until captured. An example
			inference may be that the loss of both Bishops from a board has had an impact on the religion of the pieces in
			play or that a messy divorce between a player's King and Queen will have a negative impact on morale.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any action or inference which is accepted by all players succeeds. A successful action could be a one-time
			occurrence, permitted for the rest of the game, or a group may chose to make a new house rule for future games of
			<i>Exciting Chess</i>. Successful actions are legal moves and successful inferences become facts about the world
			of play. Actions may be influenced by inferences which may, in turn, require the occurrence of specific actions to
			become true.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Exciting Chess</i> is meant to be a silly and friendly game. New rules and inferences are at their best when
			they are small in scope and don't make the game unfair. For example, a rule that says "now that the bishops are
			gone, my king wants to try transitioning into the queen he's always wanted to be" might be an agreeable rule for
			one group of players but another player might require that queens can also be put in check to keep things fair.
		</p>
		<h2>Additional information</h2>
		<p>
			If you are interested in playing <i>Exciting Chess</i> and constructing your own library of house rules
			organically, you have already learned everything you need to know. If you wish to see a couple of rule sets I have
			polished for inspiration or as part of specific improv groups, read on.
		</p>

		<h1 id="house-rules">Example House Rules</h1>
		<p>
			These are the typical rules I play with in my own <i>Exciting Chess</i> games. They are not required for every
			game and would not always make sense to use with every group of players. They are provided primarily for
			inspiration and as a starting point for any group building their own library of rules for <i>Exciting Chess</i>.
		</p>
		<h2 id="pieces">Pieces</h2>
		<h3>King</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The king is a ruling monarch of each player's board.</li>
			<li>The king must be captured like any other piece to end the game. There are no consequences to staying in check.</li>
			<li>The king moves exactly one space horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
			<li>Modified castling rules apply.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Queen</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The queen is a monarch.</li>
			<li>The queen moves any number of vacant spaces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
			<li>The queen can, in certain circumstances, become a ruling monarch.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Castle (Rook)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The castle is a structure.</li>
			<li>The castle is a noble's home.</li>
			<li>The castle moves any number of vacant spaces horizontally or vertically.</li>
			<li>Modified castling rules apply.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Bishop</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The bishop is a dismounted unit.</li>
			<li>The bishop is a representative of the church.</li>
			<li>The church cannot run without bishops.</li>
			<li>The bishop moves any number of vacant spaces diagonally.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Knight (and Horse)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The knight is a mounted unit.</li>
			<li>The knight cannot function without mutual understanding between rider and steed.</li>
			<li>A dismounted knight becomes a pawn, dismounting to any adjacent space to the horse.</li>
			<li>A riderless horse cannot capture pieces.</li>
			<li>A pawn or dismounted unit of equivalent rank may mount a riderless horse.</li>
			<li>The knight moves to one of the nearest spaces not on the same row, column, or diagonal.</li>
			<li>The knight may jump over pieces.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Pawn</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The pawn is a dismounted infantry unit.</li>
			<li>As in chess, the pawn has more movement rules than the other pieces.</li>
			<li>The pawn moves straight forward one space but may only do so if that space is vacant.</li>
			<li>
				If the pawn has not moved since the start of its involvement in the conflict, it may instead move two spaces
				forward as long as both spaces are vacant.
			</li>
			<li>The pawn can capture an enemy piece in any space ahead of it diagonally and move to that space.</li>
			<li>Modified en passant and promotion rules apply.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="pieces">Rules</h2>
		<h3>Check and Checkmate</h3>
		Unlike Chess, a monarch may choose to endanger itself and remain in check. Any player who places an opposing monarch
		in check may announce that they have done so, but it is not required. A player defending check may choose not to
		move the targeted monarch out of danger. There is no checkmate in <i>Exciting Chess</i>. A monarch may be captured
		like any other piece.
		<h3>Castling</h3>
		A monarch may castle only with its home castle. This is typically the castle that is closest to the monarch when
		they enter the conflict or at the time of their royal ascension.
		<h3>En Passant</h3>
		A pawn may make an en passant capture at any point on the board as long as the pawn has never captured another piece
		previously.
		<h3>Promotion</h3>
		A pawn reaching the home territory of an opposing army may be promoted to any higher station. Any piece may be
		demoted to a lower station by returning to the home territory of its own army. Barring atypical circumstances, an
		army may have at most two monarchs of any kind.
		<h2>Determination of Victory</h2>
		<h3>Peace</h3>
		Players may, at any time, make a deal for peace. As long as the conditions of the deal remain fulfilled, these
		players will remain at peace. Players at peace cannot capture any opponent's pieces. If all surviving players are at
		peace with one-another, these players jointly win the game. A player may choose to redeclare war at any point, but
		doing so may have consequences (such as the betrayed player being upset).
		<h3>Surrender</h3>
		A player may surrender at any time to one of their opponents. In this scenario, all of the players monarchs are
		immediately captured by that opponent. All other pieces under the surrendering player's control are transferred to
		the opposing player. Some pieces may oppose this change of leadership and be captured instead at the surrendering
		player's discretion.
		<h3>Elimination of the Chain of Command</h3>
		A player loses when they are no longer able to effectively issue orders of war while remaining at conflict with
		another player. The most common way to reach this end condition is the capture of a player's ruling monarchs while a
		line of royal succession has not been established. There may be other ways to trigger this type of defeat.
		<h3>Points</h3>
		Points are everything and good game design demands they be complicated. Several actions in <i>Exciting Chess</i>
		will generate points. Each rule around points will describe which win condition these points contribute toward and
		how points are earned toward that goal.
		<h2>Points Rules</h2>
		<h3>Capture</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Every opposing piece captured offers several points depending on its rank.
				<ul>
					<li>Pieces of lesser rank to pawns yield no points.</li>
					<li>Pieces of similar rank to pawns and dismounted knights yield one point.</li>
					<li>Pieces of similar rank to bishops and knights yield two points.</li>
					<li>
						Structural pieces such as castles yield two points while providing infrastructure value to their army
						and only one point otherwise.
					</li>
					<li>Pieces of greater rank but less than that of a monarch yield three points.</li>
					<li>Non-ruling monarch pieces yield four points while ruling monarchs yield five.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Every ten capture points yields one point of infamy.</li>
			<li>Capture points cannot be reduced.</li>
			<li>
				A player may declare victory when their capture points exceed the remaining possible capture points in the game.
				<ul>
					<li>This value is determined by the maximum points each piece left in play could yield without promotion.</li>
					<li>Opposing players are not required in any way to accept this declaration of victory.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				In the event of a peaceful resolution to the conflict, the surviving player with the most conflict points may
				declare ultimate victory.
				<ul>
					<li>This declaration cannot be opposed except by a surviving player with equal conflict points.</li>
					<li>
						Other surviving players may surrender to each other at any point during this disagreement in order to
						increase their capture scores for opposition.
					</li>
					<li>
						In the event of an opposed declaration, conflict resumes only between those players.
						<ul>
							<li>
								If any surviving player's capture points meet or exceed one of the conflicting player's capture points,
								they may rejoin the conflict.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Infamy</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Infamy points are a representation of how fearsome an army is.</li>
			<li>
				They do not contribute directly to any determination of victory but may be a prerequisite for some actions and
				assumptions to take place.
			</li>
			<li>A player may not demand surrender from any more infamous opposing player.</li>
			<li>A player may not surrender to any less infamous opposing player.</li>
		</ul>
